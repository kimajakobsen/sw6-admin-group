\chapter{Analysis}
\label{chap:analysis}
\myTop{In this chapter we present our analysis of the platform on which our final system depends and the concept of project groups.
In \secref{sec:moodleplatform} concepts of Moodle are presented and analyzed.
We introduce the concept of project groups in \secref{sec:projectgroups}, where different aspects of a project are considered.
Decisions are not made in this chapter, rather a foundation is build to allow design and implementation decisions in later chapters.}
