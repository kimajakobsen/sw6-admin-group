\section{MyMoodle}
MyMoodle is the system we as the four groups collaboratively have developed.
In this section we will evaluate on the the product, which we created.


In this project we created an extension to Moodle, which supports education through the Aalborg PBL model. 
The extension, or more precisely the extensions, gives the students and their supervisor a virtual representation of their project group. 
The tools allow them to communicate internally through a message board and a black board or communicate with their supervisor through the supervisor message board.
%These boards makes it easy to save communication threads and thereby not loosing them in email conversations. 
The students can make appointments with themselves or  their supervisor through the timeline tool.


\subsection{Decomposition}
We chose to split the entire multi-project into four parts based on the core principles of PBL. 
In retrospect the split could have been done more harmonic than it is.
Our group got the task of implementing the project group administration and the virtual group room, which is two very separate tasks with different end user groups. 
The black board tool could be merged with the message board tool by integration an existing drawing application, such as google apps, which is already integrated in Moodle by a 3\rds{} party extension~\cite{moodlegoogleapp}. 
A new decomposition will then be:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Management
	\item Planning
	\item Communication
	\item Virtual Group Room
\end{itemize}
