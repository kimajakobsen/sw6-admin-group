%because many people -> agile. our version of scrum
Due to the large number of people that work together in this project, we need a development method that takes this into account.
Furthermore, the development method also needs to take into account that we are working on a platform (namely Moodle), which most of us are unfamiliar with.

We choose to use the development method Scrum\ref{} with a few changes.
The reason for why we cannot use Scrum in its original form is that we do not have all the required personnel. 
Scrum requires an on-site costumer and a product owner.
