\section{Lene Winther Even}
Interviewers: Kim A. Jacobsen and Mikael Midtgaard\\


This interview was conducted on March 15\ths{} at Cassiopeia at Aablorg University.
At the time of writing Lene is a Senior Secretary at Aalborg University, and one of her tasks is to handle many aspects of Moodle for the Institute of Computer Science.

The following is a transcript of the interview.

\subsection{Moodle in General}
It is a problem that there are 13 different Moodle systems at Aalborg University, especially since some student are required to use more than one Moodle system.

When there is a change in a calender event it is difficult to administer in Moodle.

Only students, administrative personnel, teachers, supervisors use Moodle.
Research groups currently do not use Moodle to share information.

\subsection{Project Groups}
Project groups are created manually by writing them in a course.
Currently the university view groups and projects as one.
Messages for project groups are sent by email.
This could be improved by sending the messages through Moodle.
