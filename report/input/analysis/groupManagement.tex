\section{Project Group Management}
\label{sec:groupManagement}
From \secref{sec:virtualMeetingPlace} we know that we need notion of projects or project groups. In either case the projects or project groups must be created in some way. 
\todo{I det her kapitel er der anvendt project group når der tales om Moodle og groups eller student groups når der tales IRL, Sørg for det giver mening når du læser det igennem ellers så ret det.}
\subsection{Creation, edition, and deletion of project groups} %% Very much working title
% Creation % Editing (Change of name and similar, add members) % Deletion
During the meetings with ELSA,  see \secref{sub:elsaInterview}, and the administrative personnel we discovered three different approaches to administrate the project groups: Automatic management through external application, manual management by administrative personnel, and administration by students. 


\subsubsection{Automatic Management}
%% Automatic Creation(Proposed by ELSA) (Michael)
In this section a proposed group management approach is explored.  

ELSA propose that project groups should be created automatic through an external system. 
This technique is already used at the Aalborg University to create courses. 
The courses are not populated automatic, but it still eases the work load for the administrative personnel.  
A similar approach can be used to create project groups from an external database containing the student groups. 

With automatic management through an external system it is necessary to synchronize Moodle with the external system in the case that the groups are changed. 
If the data is inputted only in the external system a one-directional synchronization is needed, but if groups can be created, added, and deleted in Moodle a bidirectional synchronization service must be created. 
This service must be able to handle conflicts if the conflicting changes are done a the external application and Moodle at the same time.

After an interview with Michael SOMETHING from IST(REF TIL MORTEN) we discovered that AAU does not have a single system containing the groups at the University.
There exists several and some of the systems are not even online.
Furthermore, some departments does not keep official records of the project groups (From interview with Morten Mathiasen Andersen, see \appref{sec:morten}).
He explained that the systems does not have an API from which the groups can be extracted and he himself is working on an API for one of the systems.
%Without an API from which to extract the groups this approac. 

 
%%% Maintanance 


\subsubsection{User self management}
%% User- self-Creation  (Else talks about maintanance should be done by students)
In this section an approach which lets students create, edit, and delete groups themselves is discussed. 

In some cases the administrative personnel is not aware of which student groups are created (REF MORTEN) and it is not guaranteed that all students want an online project group in Moodle. 
Therefore, can the administration of the project groups be given to the students themselves, allowing the students to create and edit their project groups as needed without adding extra workload to the administrative personnel.

The problem of this approach is that students might create badly named groups or misuse the system by e.g. destroying groups for other students. 
This approach must include various security constraints to ensure proper use. 
Students should not be able to delete groups they are not members of or to delete groups by mistake. 
A mistaken deletion of a group late in the semester could lead to large amount of missed information and lost work. 
The creator of the project group must be able to govern who can be member or the members of the group must accept new members.
Alternatively they should not be able to add or remove members from a group after creation since a student should not be able to join a group they do not belong with. 





\subsubsection{Administrative personnel management}
%% Administration personel creation (Lene creates courses and notes who is in the groups)
In this section the approach of letting the administrative personnel administrate project groups is discussed. 

The administrative personnel plays a central role in the administration of the courses and student groups and is thereby capable of adding the necessary project groups to Moodle. 
Since the administrative personnel is trained professionals this approach ensures that only the needed project groups are created and that they are maintained properly. 
%That is with good naming convention.
A drawback of this approach is that it adds more work to the administrative personnel. 


\subsection{Archiving}
\label{sub:analysarchiving}
% Archiving (ELSA, Lene & Jette) (Indbygget archive restore og courses)
From the meeting with ELSA, see \secref{sub:elsaInterview}, we know they archive courses at the end of each semester. 
Lene Winther Even explains that it is to preserve the content for future reference, see \appref{sec:lene}. 
Morten Mathiasen Andersen, see \appref{sec:morten}, explains that teachers use the archived versions of a course to create a new course of the same subject. 
ELSA proposed that project groups can be archived for the same purpose so teacher and students can look back at their previous work.
In Moodle it is possible to backup and restore courses, which allows teachers to take a snapshot of their course materials. 
This feature is not used by ELSA to archive courses.
Instead they copy the courses and its contents.
A similar approach can be used to archive project groups for future reference.
