\chapter{Analysis \& Design}
\myTop{In this chapter we analyze the requirements and design our sub-system for implementation.
We split our \subsystem{} into two sections, which are analyzed and designed in \secref{sec:virtualMeetingPlace} and \secref{sec:groupManagement}.
The complete architecture of \system{} is presented in \secref{sec:architecture}, and in \secref{sec:dbdesign} the database design of our \subsystem{} is presented.
This chapter makes a foundation for our sub-system and its implementation.}%

The requirements from \secref{sec:requirements} are used in this chapter to analyze and design our \subsystem{}.
%One section being the usage of project groups, we call this part ``Virtual Meeting Place''.
%The other being the administration of project groups, called ``Project Group Management''.
%This division is corresponding to our division of end users in \secref{sec:enduser}.
%The analysis and design of each to part is presented in \secref{sec:virtualMeetingPlace} and \secref{sec:groupManagement} respectively.
Analysis and design is presented together for simplicity.
