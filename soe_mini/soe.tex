\section{Introduction}
This mini project is divided into three parts: development approach, tools and techniques, and evaluation.
\subsection{The Project}
The project which this mini project is based upon is a multi project with four subgroups.
The project is to develop an extension to the e-learning system Moodle, which supports problem-based learning.
We approach the project by dividing the project into four smaller subparts.
The four subparts are: Intra group communication, planning, administration, and group-supervisor-communication.

\section{Development Approach}

\subsection{Distinguishing Factors}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item 14 persons in 4 groups
	\item Diverse target group
	\item No on-site costumer
	\item Hard deadline
	\item Passed on project
	\item Known framework and platform
	\item Education environment
	\item Not full-time development
	\item No manager/Project owner
\end{enumerate}
