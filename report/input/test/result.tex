\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

In this section we evaluate the test cases code coverage. 
Moodle has an inbuilt functionality for line coverage of unit tests, which we use to measure the code coverage.

We have to unit test files, one for the project group library and one for the admin tool library. 
And a report is generated for both and can be seen in \appref{app:localcc} and \appref{app:admincc}.
The line coverage for the project group library is $68.09\%$ and $77.06\%$ for the admin tool lirary.

As stated in \secref{sec:strategy} a good line coverage for a production sites code coverage is \idealCC{}.
Our line coverage is above this and considered acceptable for the kind of system we are building. 
Striving to achieve more will not give a cost/beneficial result \todo{cite til testing her}. 
Our tests are combined with several UI tests which helps find bugs and ensure better quality of the product.
