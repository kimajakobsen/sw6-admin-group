\chapter{Implementation}
\myTop{In this chapter we describe how we implement the concepts described in \secref{chap:design}.
This chapter is divided into two sections where the two main parts of our system are described, namely \nameref{sec:projGroupRoomImpl} and \nameref{sec:manProjGrpImpl}.
The implementation details presented here are paramount for \chapref{chap:test} and \chapref{chap:evalProduct}.}
In the implementation of project groups we are faced with several choices. 
Project groups can be implemented as courses (see \secref{sub:courses}) by creating a new view for the course page.  
This will make it possible to use activity modules, described in \ref{par:activitymodules}, in the project group. 
Another approach is to make a local plugin, which gives us basic functionality, such as database installation. 
With a local plugin we cannot use activity modules since they are too strongly connected to courses. 
Instead we can use blocks for the functionality. 
The later approach is chosen.
