\myTop{In this chapter we present the constraints that \moodle{} sets for \system{}, the core concepts of \moodle{}, and the framework in which \system{} is integrated.
%It is important to understand the system that we are developing an extension for.
This is important since it gives an understanding of the environment in which \system{} should function, and which features it can use from the underlying system.
