\section{Architecture}
To implment MyMoodle a lot of different moodle plugins are needed. 

To make sure that groups work as intended and dependicues are not too fluffy we need an layered archtecture


MyMoodle can be seen as a plugin of plugins. 

The architecture does not specify how exactly which plugins should be created but specify a general structuring of the parts of the system. 

The complete architecture can be seen in figure JADAJADA

The box surrounding the parts illustrates a common dependency of the moodle platform. 
Every part, except for the database, is dependent on moodle to work.
