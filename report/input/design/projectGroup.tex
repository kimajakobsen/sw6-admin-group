\section{Project Group}
In this section the different aspects of the concept of the group room will be described.
\subsection{Project Group Room}
A project group room is a page that serves as a virtual group room. 
It should have some of the same functionality as a physical group room.
We as the \groupname{} implement the page, and other three groups implement the blocks(see section \ref{subsec:blocks}) that serve as different functionality.
A good aspect of using blocks is that it is easy to manage which blocks should be shown and where they should be shown on the page.
