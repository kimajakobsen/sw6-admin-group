This report is the documentation of the project conducted in the period from \myDate{1}{2}{2012} to \myDate{4}{6}{2012} by the software student group, sw608f12.
The project is the outcome of the 6th semester at Aalborg University. 
The overall theme of the multi-project is: ``Application Development''. 
The project is a part of a multi-project consisting of four groups. 
The first part of the report is written in corporation between the four groups of the multi-project while this preface and part two and three are written entirely by our group. 

In code snippets through out the report the notation of three dots (...)  can be seen.
This notation illustrates these omitment of one or more lines of code. 
Code is only omitted in situations where those lines are not important to the description of the code. 

The first part of every chapter in Parts \ref{part:evaluation} and \ref{part:development} is a header, which very briefly describe what the given chapter contains and why it is important to the project.
