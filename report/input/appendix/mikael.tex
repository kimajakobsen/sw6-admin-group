AdmDB is a tool used by administrative personal at Cassiopeia. It contains information about student and the project groups.
It was developed as a supportive system to the old Typo3 system. When project groups are typed into the system, a repository is created for the given group. A project group have the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
	\item An group room alias
	\item Room number

	\item Students
	\item A period where the project group is active
