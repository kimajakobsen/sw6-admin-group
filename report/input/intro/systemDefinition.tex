\section{System Definition}
\label{sec:subSysDef}
The selected requirements are: Managing Project Groups, Virtual Meeting Place, Introduce Roles, Find Project Groups, Navigate to Project Groups, and Project Group Members. 
Based on the definition of the entire system and the selected requirements we define the \subsystem{} we are implementing as: 
\input{input/defineproblem/probdef}
The subsystem must conform to the overall system definition, defined in \chapref{chap:systemDef}.
This definition and the definition of the entire system (see \chapref{chap:systemDef}) is concluded upon in our conclusion in \chapref{chap:conclusion}.
