\section{System Definition}
From the initial analysis and the intro to this chapter we define the subsystem we are implementing as: \todo{find  what exactly this shoulkd reference}
\begin{center}
\framebox[0.85\textwidth][c]{
	\parbox{0.8\textwidth}{
		\textsl{
			A subsystem of \system{} that implements project groups in Moodle and allow for administration and usage thereof. 
			The subsystem includes a virtual group room, which integrates the other subsystems. 
		}
	}
}
\end{center}
The subsystem must conform to the overall system definition, defined in~\secref{sec:systemDef}, and may not interfere with existing Moodle functionality.
