\chapter{Analysis \& Design}
\myTop{In this chapter we analyze our system and design it for implementation.
Our \subsystem{} is split into two parts, which are analyzed and designed separately in \secref{sec:virtualMeetingPlace} and \secref{sec:groupManagement}.
The complete architecture of \system{} is presented in \secref{sec:architecture}.
This chapter makes a foundation for our implementation.}
