\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chap:conclusion}
\myTop{In this chapter the project is concluded upon in two ways. Initially we will conclude upon the multi-project, and then we will conclude upon our sub-project.}
\section{Multi-Project}
\label{sec:multiconclusion}
In the first part of this report the system definition for the multi-project, \system{}, is presented as the following: 

%shared system statement
\sharedInput{system_definition}

\section{Sub-Project}
\label{sec:subconclusion}

In the second part we defined the definition of the sub-system we as four people developed during this project.
The system was defined as:

%our system statement

\framebox[0.85\textwidth][c]{
	\parbox{0.8\textwidth}{
		\textsl{
			A subsystem of \system{} that implements project groups in Moodle and allow for administration and usage thereof. 
			The subsystem includes a virtual meeting place, which integrates the other subsystems. 
		}
	}
}
\end{center}

We implemented a administration tool in accordance with Moodle standards.
By using this tool administrators are able to add, edit, and delete project groups.
In order to accommodate for a large number of project groups we have created a page with a list of all project groups.
Finding a specific project group or a specific set of project groups is possible by using filtering.
Additionally, we created a project group room page.
Each project group has one of such pages associated with it.
This page shows all the group members with name and profile picture, and allows .........................
