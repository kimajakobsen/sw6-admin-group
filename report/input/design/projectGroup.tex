\section{Project Group}
\label{sec:projectgroup}
In this section the different aspects of the concept of the project groups will be described.
First we want to introduce the concept of a virtual meeting places for project groups.
How to navigate through the project groups is described afterwards.
Finally the design decisions regarding management of project groups is described.

\subsection{Navigation}
\label{sub:designprojectgroupnavigation}
There is currently a problem in Moodle when it comes to navigation. 
When a user is enrolled in a large number of courses their entire front page is filled with links to those courses.
There is no built-in functionality to move or sort the links.
ELSA mentioned this problem during the meeting that we conducted with them described in \secref{sub:elsaInterview}.

We want to avoid this problem when we design the navigation for project groups.
Moodle has a navigation block with a list of important links.
We want to add an item to this list that, when expanded, shows the project groups the user is a member of.
Since a supervisor or an administrator might be a member of a many project groups, we want to limit the size of the list of project groups.
We do this by showing at max a preset value, and if the user is a member of more groups we show a link to a page that has a list of all the users's group.

\subsection{Managing Project Groups}
\label{sec:s}
Administrators need to be able to add, remove, and edit project groups.
Per default Moodle has a block called Settings. 
If a user is an administrator there is a list in this block called site administration. 
This list contains a lot of tools administrators use, and it is only natural to add project group administration to this list. 

We want a page where administrators can add a new project group that also adheres to Moodle standards.
It should be possible to name a group, add the desired members, and choose who the supervisor(s) of the group is/are.

Additionally there needs to be a list of all project groups.
This list can potentiality grow very large, so there needs a way of finding a specific group or a specific set of groups. \todo{lene interview ref}
From this list it should be possible to add, edit, and delete groups. 

The project group administration should be implemented in such a way that it does not decrease the efficiency for the administrative personal compared to the old system. 
This measure can only be used in placed where an existing project group administration system is used.
