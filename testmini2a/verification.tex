\section{Verification}
To verify that there is a trace leading to a state where all persons are on the right side we use the following statement:
$E<> Boy1.L == 1 \&\& Boy2.L == 1 \&\& Girl1.L == 1 \&\& Girl2.L == 1 \&\& Dad.L == 1 \&\& Mom.L == 1 \&\& Police.L == 1 \&\& Thief.L == 1$
The statement says that there exist a path where the property holds at some point, which is exactly what we want. 
To find the shortest trace we use breadth-first search and with the diagnostic trace set to shortest. 

If more people are added to system the statement simply has to be expanded with more conjunctions. 

To verify that the system never deadlocks we use the statement:
$A[] !deadlock$ which fails. 
One known place of a deadlock is if verify fails in some edges the system cannot go anywhere else and there it is said to be deadlocked. 
This does not matter since it is not a requirement that the system must be deadlock free.
