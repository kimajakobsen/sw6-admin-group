\section{Assignment}
This section will describe the assignment at hand.
The assignment is defined as:

Help a family shown below to cross a river according to the following constraints:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Max 2 persons on the boat,
	\item Mom not alone with boys,
	\item Dad not alone with girls,
	\item Thief not alone with family,
	\item Only police officer, dad and mom can handle the boat.
\end{itemize}
We have taken the meaning of e.g. ``Mom not alone with boys'' to mean that the mom is not allowed to be the only person except boys on one side or on the boat.
We highlight this because we have noticed that the interactive version of the game given on the webpage for this assignment take a different meaning to this restriction.
E.g. it does not allow the mom to be on one side with only a boy and a girl.

The required tasks are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Task 1: Make a Uppaal model of it and generate a feasible schedule.
  \item Task 2: Add temporal constraints (e.g. each adult takes a certain time to cross the river with the boat) and try to find the quickest possible schedule.
  \item Task 3: Determine the feasibility limit depending on the number of boys, girls, prisonners.
  \item Task 4: Try other parameters and constraints for this game.
\end{itemize}
