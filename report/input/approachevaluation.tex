\chapter{Development Approach}
\myTop{In this chapter we discuss and evaluate our development approach.
This is split into the two sections \nameref{sec:intergroup} and \nameref{sec:intragroupdev}.
The evaluation of our development approach in important since it forces us to learn what works well.
Additionally the evaluation is a service to the students taking over the project.
Hopefully they will learn from our mistakes and use what we have found to work well.
%The evaluation of our development approach is not tied to our final product, \system{}, but it is important to show that we understand and can reflect on our choices and their consequences regarding development approach.
}
We chose the development method \scrum{}, which is described in \secref{par:scrum}, refined in \secref{sub:rescrum} and \chapref{sec:developmentpractice}.
%The development approach that we have chosen is a combination of the chosen method, \scrum{}, described and refined in \secref{par:scrum} and \secref{sub:rescrum} respectively, and the additional practices presented in \chapref{sec:developmentpractice}.
%The additional practices include test driven development. \todo{Any other??}
%I know i know, selt de to første linjer :s
%Der skal bare være noget med forskellen på dev method, dev practice og dev approach et sted
